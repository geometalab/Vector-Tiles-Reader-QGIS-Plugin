# Vector Tiles Reader QGIS-Plugin

This Python plugin reads Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) from a local MBTiles file and loads them into a vector layer that is rendered by QGIS and it's (default) styling.

_>> This is work in (slow) progress! Expected release is around June 2017. <<_

For more information about the Vector Tiles concept and limitations of the plugin see homepage.
